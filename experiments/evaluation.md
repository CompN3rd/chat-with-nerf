# Evaluations

## No GPT + LeRF

There is one function called act_no_gpt. Disable all the singleton code. Connect no gpt function with that.

One example:
```
chat-with-nerf/experiments/evaluation_without_gpt_lerf_final.ipynb
```

## With GPT + LeRF

Current code can handle but better disable singleton code.

One example:
```
chat-with-nerf/experiments/evaluate_lerf_14_with_gpt.ipynb
```

## No GPT + OpenScene

There is one function called act_no_gpt. Disable all the singleton code. Connect no gpt function with that.

One example:
```
chat-with-nerf/experiments/evaluate_baseline_openscene.ipynb
```

## With GPT + OpenScene

Current code can handle but better disable singleton code.

One example:
```
chat-with-nerf/experiments/evaluation_with_gpt_openscene_no_visual_feedback.ipynb
